    <p>For every survey that is performed in the world, one of the primary purposes is to relate what you are surveying to something <span class="fst-italic">else.</span> Usually this <span class="fst-italic">else</span> is a well defined line that has been agreed upon by the community, such as a plat line, section line, or rights-of-way lines. This allows for both peer-reviews of our work and for other surveys to be based on the work we do with relative confidence. There are a few benefits to defining this line: ability to retrace your steps, evidence of boundary locations, and being in legal compliance to name a few.</p>
    <p>There is also a rather large concern that is remedied by defining this line. Prior to the popularization of the Global Positioning System (GPS), the only way to relate properties was to reference known points and lines. Using sectional information and known points is still the strongest and most persuasive ways to prove the location of boundaries. With the use of GPS rovers and real-time kinematic positioning, some surveyor's can remove time by providing coordinates in either the global space (WGS-84 latitude and longitude, or State Plane Coordinate zones). Issues can arise if these corners and lines are not recovered, both professional and legal (GPS coordinates are on the bottom of the hierarchy of evidence).</p>

    <h5>1. Determine Which Monuments You Can Use</h5>
    <p>The first step to determining your basis of bearing is to determine what monuments you have to work with. If you don't have any good monuments, then someone didn't do their job correctly and further field data will need to be collected. A general rule of thumb is that the longer the line, the better the determination. ALso consider what the monument is representing and where it is. For example, <abbr title="Permanent Reference Monument">PRMs</abbr> or <abbr title="Permanent Control Points">PCPs</abbr> have more authority than lot corners, and sectional lines usually have some authority over random iron rods. If you are working in a subdivision, it is highly advisable that you use either block corners or plat corners for your basis of bearings over iron rods found on the property.</p>
    <h5>2. Determine bearings and distances between monuments.</h5>
    <p>Once you determine which corners are possibly viable for holding, the next step is to verify bearing and distances between those points.<span class="alert-info"> Monuments are never going to be perfect in either bearing or distance. </span>At this point, we are simply noting what the bearings and distances are so we can compare in the next step.</p>
    <h5>3. Referencing a plat, legal description, or other authoritative document; determine which lines are closest to record.</h5>
    <p>Now comes the fun (or frustrating) part of determination. We need to figure out which line and which monument we are going to hold. We do this by taking our measured information from step 2 and comparing that information to record information such as a plat or legal description. Make sure to look both forwards and backwards along a line as differences in distances cause difference in supporting evidence. By the end of this analysis, you should have a point (benchmark) that you want to hold and a bearing from that point to another point.</p>
    <h5>4. Place your linework on one monument and rotate to the other monument so your basis line matches the monuments.</h5>
    <p>With your point and bearing you wish to hold, find that point on your linework. This first monument may be referred a benchmark (for the purposes of this article). Rotate your linework with respect from your benchmark to your second point. Usually this is through a line of commonality that has been previously defined, though special cases can be used if properly supported.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-danger">Never move your points, always move your linework.</div>
    <h5>5. Check all of your other monuments in both direction error and distance error.</h5>
    <p>Now that your linework is on a benchmark and rotated to a possible basis of bearing, it is time to check all the other monuments you have, including monuments you didn't previously consider for this process. With each monument, you are checking for both directional and distance error. After looking at your other monuments, you can begin to make assumptions about the accuracy of your current determination such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If there is small distance error (&#60; 0.15' linear) and the directional errors are in different directions, you most likely have a good determination. <span class="alert-success">You are done!</span></li>
      <li>If there is small distance error (&#60; 0.15' linear) and the directional errors are in the same direction, it may be that your benchmark is itself an erroneous, try using the other point or another point all together.</li>
      <li>If there is a larger distance error (&#62; 0.15' linear) and the directional errors are in the same direction, the benchmark is more than likely erroneous and another point needs to be used.</li>
      <li>If there is a larger distance error (&#62; 0.15' linear) and the directional errors are in the different directions, it may be that your benchmark is itself an erroneous or the monuments are not in harmony, try using the other point or advise the PSM.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At the end of the day, you are looking for the <q>best fit</q> scenario between the found monuments and record linework. Once this determination is made, the other monuments can be further determined if they are within tolerance or need to be removed and reset (another topic).</p>
